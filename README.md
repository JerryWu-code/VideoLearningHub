EDULink: A centralised adaptive learning platform

Centralised Learning Hub:
Multi-Source Video and Articles: Users can access videos, articles, PDFs, and research papers from multiple sources on the same topic, all in one place.
Categorised Learning Paths: Different paths based on subjects or skills (e.g., “Maths Path,” “Programming Path”) with curated resources from various websites and platforms.
Integration with YouTube/External Platforms: Embed educational videos from YouTube, Vimeo, or other platforms to ensure users have access to different content formats.

Interactive Transcript with Notes:
Real-Time Video Transcripts: Automatically generated transcripts for videos, allowing users to follow along, read, or reference key points later.
Highlighting & Note-Taking: Users can highlight sections of the transcript or text from articles and save personalised notes for later review.
Auto-Save Notes: Notes are auto-saved with timestamps (for videos) or text references, so users can go back to specific parts of the material.
