**EDULink: A centralised adaptive learning platform**

**Centralised Learning Hub:**

1. Multi-Source Video and Articles: Users can access videos, articles, PDFs, and research papers from multiple sources on the same topic, all in one place.

2. Categorised Learning Paths: Different paths based on subjects or skills (e.g., “Maths Path,” “Programming Path”) with curated resources from various websites and platforms.

3. Integration with YouTube/External Platforms: Embed educational videos from YouTube, Vimeo, or other platforms to ensure users have access to different content formats.

**Interactive Transcript with Notes:**

1. Real-Time Video Transcripts: Automatically generated transcripts for videos, allowing users to follow along, read, or reference key points later.

2. Highlighting & Note-Taking: Users can highlight sections of the transcript or text from articles and save personalised notes for later review.

3. Auto-Save Notes: Notes are auto-saved with timestamps (for videos) or text references, so users can go back to specific parts of the material.
